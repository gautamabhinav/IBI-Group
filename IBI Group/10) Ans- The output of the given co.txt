10) Ans:- The output of the given code will be:

```
1
4
2
3
```

Explanation:

1. `console.log(1);`: This is a synchronous operation, so it will be executed first and log `1` to the console.

2. `setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);`: This line schedules the `printNumber` function to be executed asynchronously with a delay of 0 milliseconds. Even though the delay is specified as 0, it is still considered an asynchronous operation and will be added to the event queue. Since it has a very short delay, it will be executed as soon as the current synchronous code execution is complete.

3. `setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);`: This line schedules another `printNumber` function to be executed asynchronously, but this time with a delay of 100 milliseconds. It will be added to the event queue after the previous `setTimeout`.

4. `console.log(4);`: This is another synchronous operation and will be executed after `console.log(1);`, logging `4` to the console.

Now, let's examine the event loop and the execution order:

- Synchronous code execution:
  - `console.log(1);` -> Output: `1`
  - `setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);` and `setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);` are added to the event queue.

- Event loop (after the synchronous code execution is complete):
  - The first item in the event queue (`setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);`) is ready to be executed, and it has a delay of 0ms, so it will be executed immediately. The `printNumber` function will log `2` to the console. Output: `2`

  - The second item in the event queue (`setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);`) has a delay of 100ms, so it will be executed after 100 milliseconds. The `printNumber` function will log `3` to the console. Output: `3`

- Synchronous code execution:
  - `console.log(4);` -> Output: `4`

So, the final output sequence is: `1`, `4`, `2`, `3`.
