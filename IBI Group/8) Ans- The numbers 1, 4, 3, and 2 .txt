8) Ans:- The numbers 1, 4, 3, and 2 will be logged to the console when the code is executed. The order and timing are as follows:

1. `console.log(1);` - This is a synchronous operation and will be executed first, logging `1` to the console immediately.

2. `setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);` - This line schedules a callback function to be executed after 1000 milliseconds (1 second). Since this is an asynchronous operation, the JavaScript engine will continue executing the next statements without waiting for the timeout to complete.

3. `setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);` - This line also schedules a callback function to be executed after 0 milliseconds. Despite the `0` delay, it is still an asynchronous operation, and the callback will be placed in the event queue to be executed after the current code block finishes.

4. `console.log(4);` - This is another synchronous operation and will be executed after `console.log(1);`, logging `4` to the console.

Now, the synchronous part of the code execution is complete, and the event loop will start checking the event queue. The callback for `setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);` will be picked up from the queue, and `3` will be logged to the console.

Finally, after approximately 1 second (due to the 1000ms delay in the first `setTimeout`), the callback for `setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);` will be picked up from the queue, and `2` will be logged to the console.

Therefore, the final order of the numbers logged to the console will be: 1, 4, 3, 2.
